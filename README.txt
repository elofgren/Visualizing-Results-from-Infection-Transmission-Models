This repository contains electronic supplemental material for the above
named article. This includes the following files:

visualizing_code.r: The R code necessary to reproduce the analysis and
data visualization featured in the manuscript.

Visualizing_data.csv: A comma-separated dataset of the epidemic
simulation used as a worked data visualization example in the
manuscript. This file is necessary to run the included R code, and to
exactly replicate the results of the stochastic epidemic simulation.

eFigure1.eps: A supplemental figure combining several methods of
visualization to both show the full scope of simulation results and
highlight specific trajectories of interest.
